| **Global Spatially-Disaggregated Crop Production Statistics Data for 2010 Version 1.1** |                                                              | SPAM provides key crop production indicators, including area, production, and yield, for 42 crops — disaggregated at the input-levels (e.g., irrigated/rainfed and high/low-input) on 10 km grids globally. The SPAM team at IFPRI ([Liangzhi You](http://www.ifpri.org/profile/liangzhi-you), [Ulrike Wood-Sichra](http://www.ifpri.org/profile/ulrike-wood-sichra), [Zhe Guo](http://www.ifpri.org/profile/zhe-guo), [Yating Ru](http://www.ifpri.org/profile/yating-ru), and [Jawoo Koo](http://www.ifpri.org/profile/jawoo-koo)) works closely with CGIAR’s crop commodity-focused centers (e.g., CIMMYT for maize and wheat, AfricaRice and IRRI for rice, IITA and CIAT for tropical crops such as banana, plantains, and cassava, CIP for potatoes, and ICRISAT for sorghum, millet, and pulses) to collect data, review model results, and improve overall data quality. Over the years IFPRI released two major updates ([SPAM 2000](http://mapspam.info/spam-2000/) and [SPAM 2005](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DHXBJX)) and a number of minor releases. This new version of [SPAM 2010 v1.0](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V) addresses all the feedback the team received on the earlier beta version of SPAM 2010. | https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V |
| SPAM 2000 is the precursor of SPAM 2005, and is based on the same methodology. |                                                              | All data files and documentation are openly provided as a global public good through IFPRI’s data repository, [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PRFF8V). The methodology of SPAM has been thoroughly reviewed and published as [peer-reviewed journal articles](http://mapspam.info/methodology/#publications) and [technical documents](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=2908858&version=RELEASED&version=.0). A number of initiatives and academic journal articles are already using SPAM as their basis of analysis.

And of course the national and sub-national statistics are scaled to FAO’s average(1999-2001),SPAM 2000 handles 20 crops: (wheat, rice, maize, barley, millet, sorghum, potato, sweet potato & yam, cassava, banana & plantain, soybean, beans, other pulses, sugar cane, sugar beet, coffee, cotton, other fibre crops, groundnut, other oilcrops) for four production systems (irrigated, rainfed-high inputs, rainfed-low inputs, and rainfed-subsistence). | https://www.mapspam.info/spam-2000/                          |
| **Global Spatially-Disaggregated Crop Production Statistics Data for 2005 Version 3.2** |                                                              | Using a variety of inputs, IFPRI's Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) uses a cross-entropy approach to make plausible estimates of crop distribution within disaggregated units. Moving the data from coarser units such as countries and sub-national provinces, to finer units such as grid cells, reveals spatial patterns of crop performance, creating a global gridscape at the confluence between geography and agricultural production systems. Improving spatial understanding of crop production systems allows policymakers and donors to better target agricultural and rural development policies and investments, increasing food security and growth with minimal environmental impacts.

Our biogeographic units are ecoregions, which are defined as relatively large units of land or water containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities sharing a large majority of species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. There are 867 terrestrial ecoregions, classified into 14 different biomes such as forests, grasslands, or deserts. Ecoregions represent the original distribution of distinct assemblages of species and communities.                                                                                                                                     **Citation:** Olson, D.
